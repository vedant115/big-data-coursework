# Lab Task 5

## 📘 Assignment Overview

This lab focuses on executing and analyzing queries using **Apache Hive** and **Apache Pig**. The goal is to practice various operators provided by both platforms and compare their performance in terms of execution time and resource usage. Queries will be executed on a structured healthcare dataset.

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Apply a range of **Hive** and **Pig** operators to process structured healthcare data.
- Design and execute both simple and complex queries.
- Perform **comparative analysis** between Hive and Pig in terms of execution time and resource usage.
- Identify any performance bottlenecks or efficiency gaps.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle - Healthcare Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset)
- **Note:** Upload the dataset to HDFS for Hive and Pig to access.

## 🧪 Query Requirements

### ✅ Simple Queries (7 total)
- Use **at least 2** and **at most 4 operators** per query.

## 📊 Comparative Analysis

1. **Execution Time**
   - Measure the execution time of each query in both Hive and Pig.
   - Record observations in a table format for comparison.

2. **Resource Utilization**
   - Analyze CPU, memory, and disk usage during query execution.
   - Note any instances of unusually high resource consumption.
