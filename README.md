# Big Data Analytics Lab Assignments ðŸš€

Welcome to my **Big Data Analytics (BDA)** lab coursework repository. This repository contains all the lab assignments performed as part of the BDA course. Each assignment demonstrates hands-on implementation of core big data tools and techniques using Hadoop, Hive, Pig, Mahout, Spark, Kafka, and more.

## ðŸ“‚ Lab Assignment Structure

Each folder below contains the relevant code, scripts, screenshots, and a detailed `README.md` for that specific lab.

| Lab | Title | Tools Used |

| [Lab 1](./LabAssign1) | Hadoop Setup and WordCount | Hadoop HDFS, MapReduce |
| [Lab 2](./LabAssign2) | Advanced MapReduce Jobs | MapReduce |
| [Lab 3](./LabAssign3) | Healthcare Data Analysis | MapReduce, HDFS |
| [Lab 4](./LabAssign4) | TB Dataset Processing | MapReduce, JobTracker |
| [Lab 5](./LabAssign5) | Hive & Pig Querying | Apache Hive, Apache Pig |
| [Lab 6](./LabAssign6) | Diabetes Classification | Apache Mahout (Naive Bayes, K-Means) |
| [Lab 7](./LabAssign7) | GraphX Analysis on TB Data | Apache Spark, GraphX, RDFLib |
| [Lab 8](./LabAssign8) | Advanced Graph Algorithms | Spark GraphX, GraphFrames |
| [Lab 9](./LabAssign9) | Real-time TB Risk Scoring | Apache Kafka, Streaming |

## ðŸ§° Tools & Frameworks Used

- Apache Hadoop (HDFS, MapReduce)
- Apache Hive & Pig
