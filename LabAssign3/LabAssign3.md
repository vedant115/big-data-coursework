# Lab Assignment 3

## üìò Assignment Overview

This lab focuses on performing various analytical tasks using Hadoop MapReduce on a healthcare dataset. The dataset includes multiple patient-related attributes such as age, gender, medical condition, admission dates, billing amount, and more. Students are required to implement specific MapReduce jobs to extract meaningful insights from this dataset.

## üóÇÔ∏è MapReduce Analysis Tasks

1. **Total Billing Amount per Hospital**
   - **Mapper:** Extract hospital name and billing amount.
   - **Reducer:** Sum billing amounts for each hospital.

2. **Average Length of Stay per Medical Condition**
   - **Mapper:** Calculate stay duration (Discharge Date - Admission Date) and emit with medical condition.
   - **Reducer:** Compute the average length of stay per condition.

3. **Most Common Medical Conditions per Age Group**
   - **Mapper:** Classify into age groups (0‚Äì18, 19‚Äì35, 36‚Äì50, 51+) and emit medical condition.
   - **Reducer:** Count conditions per age group and identify the most common ones.

4. **Most Prescribed Medications per Medical Condition**
   - **Mapper:** Emit medical condition and prescribed medication.
   - **Reducer:** Count medication frequency per condition.

5. **Average Billing Amount per Insurance Provider**
   - **Mapper:** Emit insurance provider and billing amount.
   - **Reducer:** Calculate average billing per provider.

6. **Admission Type Distribution per Hospital**
   - **Mapper:** Emit hospital name and admission type.
   - **Reducer:** Count occurrences of each admission type per hospital.

7. **Gender-wise Frequency of Medical Conditions**
   - **Mapper:** Emit gender and medical condition.
   - **Reducer:** Count condition frequency for each gender.

8. **Average Test Result Distribution per Doctor**
   - **Mapper:** Emit doctor name and test result.
   - **Reducer:** Calculate percentage of Normal, Abnormal, Inconclusive results per doctor.

9. **Most Frequently Used Hospital Rooms**
   - **Mapper:** Emit room number.
   - **Reducer:** Count how often each room was used.

10. **Billing Analysis Across Age Groups**
    - **Mapper:** Emit age group and billing amount.
    - **Reducer:** Calculate average billing per age group.
